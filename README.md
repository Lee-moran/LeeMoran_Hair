Design choices:
-Typography
The fonts chosen were 'teko' for the headings and 'Oswald' for the body text. They fall back to  sans-serif respectively.

'teko' was chosen for the headings to give the user an inital welcoming feel. The strong style generally feels more sturdy and standouts.
'Lato' is used for the body text as it provides a nice contrast to the teko whilst being easy to read for all.

Colour Scheme:
The colour scheme eventually chosen is one based on grey and off-white. The colour contrasts with a modern feel and complementary to many of the images. Giving the page a modern feel.
